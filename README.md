[What is the difference between LEFT JOIN and LEFT OUTER JOIN?](http://stackoverflow.com/a/4401540/432903), JWN, 07-2016

[Set1 INNER JOIN Set2](https://goo.gl/qZUi8K)

[Set1 OUTER JOIN Set2](https://goo.gl/IbGzK3)

```
The result of a left outer join (or simply left join) for tables A and B always contains all rows 
of the "left" table (A), even if the join-condition does not find any matching row in the "right" table (B). 
```

[LEFT OUTER JOIN operation](http://docs.oracle.com/javadb/10.4.2.1/ref/rrefsqlj18922.html) (INTV, HUM 06-08-2016)

```
It preserves the unmatched rows from the first (left) table, 
joining them with a NULL row in the shape of the second (right) table.
```

Properties
----------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID#Characteristics


| Property |  Desc  |
|-----------|-------|
| A | all or nothing // on power failures, errors, and crashes trxn is either COMMITED or ROLLED BACK |
| C | ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another. |
| I | concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially, i.e., one after the other |
| D | once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors |

Disadvantage
------------

```
The greatest disadvantage of the 2PC protocol is that it is a blocking protocol. 

If the master(coordinator) fails permanently, some secondaries(cohorts) will never resolve their 
transactions: 
After a secondary has sent an agreement message to the master, it will block until a commit or 
rollback is received.

[Database pooling](http://stackoverflow.com/a/4041136/432907)
-------------------

```
Database connection pooling is a method used to keep database TCP connections open so they can 
be reused by others.
```

https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing

[Calculating connection pool](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing#the-formula)

```bash
max_connections = ((os_core_count * 2) + effective_spindle_count)

If your little 4-Core i7 server with one hard disk: 
connection pool = ((4 * 2) + 1) = 9
